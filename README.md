# E-Commerce-Follow-Along

Project Descrition 

This project is aimed at developing an e-commerce application using the 
MERN (Mongo DB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.  
The application will showcase essential functionalities such as user authentication, 
product management, and order processing.

**Milestone 1: **

Project Overview
In this milestone, we introduced the foundations of building a full-stack e-commerce application using MERN stack.
1. Overview of the MERN Stack
The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies used for building modern, scalable, and fast web applications. The stack consists of:
MongoDB (database)
Express.js (backend framework)
React.js (frontend library)
Node.js (JavaScript runtime)
The key advantage of MERN is its JavaScript-only approach, where both the front-end and back-end are built using JavaScript, making development easier and more efficient.
2. REST API Structure and Endpoints
We explored REST APIs (Representational State Transfer) and their role in allowing communication between the client and server.
Key API endpoints were introduced to handle:
User Authentication: Register and log in users with secure authentication.
Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
Order Handling: Manage customer orders from creation to checkout.
These APIs interact with the database, responding with data in JSON format.
3. Basics of Database Schema Design
In MongoDB, schema design involves defining the structure of data stored in the database, including relationships between different collections such as users, products, and orders.
The schema plays a critical role in ensuring data consistency and making it easier to query.
4. Role of Authentication in Web Applications
Authentication verifies the identity of a user before granting access to certain features or data.
In this project, we focused on building secure authentication mechanisms, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their orders.
We implemented techniques like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to securely handle user sessions.
Features Implemented
User Authentication:

Sign up and login features using JWT for secure sessions.
Product Management:

Add, update, and view products within the e-commerce platform.
Order Management:

Create, update, and view customer orders.


**Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page**


In this milestone, we focused on setting up the initial front-end structure and implementing the login page for the application. Key achievements include:

Front-End Framework:
Set up the React framework with Vite for a fast and modern development experience.
Folder Structure:
Organized the src folder to include separate directories for components, pages, and assets to improve scalability and maintainability.
Login Page Implementation:
Developed a basic login page (Login.jsx) that includes a user interface for email and password input.
Incorporated validation logic to ensure proper user input.
Routing:
Implemented React Router for navigation and created routes for the login and signup pages.
Styling:
Added basic styling using CSS (App.css) to ensure a clean and user-friendly design.
Git Integration:
Added the new files to version control and committed progress to the GitHub repository.
This milestone lays the groundwork for creating the front-end interface and interaction logic for the application.


# Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend

In this milestone, the foundational backend structure for the e-commerce application was successfully established. Key achievements include:

Backend Folder Structure:
Organized the project into clearly defined folders ( config, controller, db, middleware, model and utility) to ensure scalability and maintainability.
Database Integration:
Set up a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose, enabling seamless interaction with the database.
Environment Congiguration
Implemented a .env file to securely manage sensitive data such as database credentials, ensuring better secuirty practives.
Middleware Implementation
Created a essential middleware for authentication, error handiling, and asynchronous error management to streamline request processing and ensure robust error handiling.

Utility Functions 
-Added rusable utility components like a custom error handler to improve consistency and simplify debugging.
